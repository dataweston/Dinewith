# Dinewith MVP

Dinewith is moving toward a two-part MVP focused on unlocking the core dining experience before layering on additional product features.

## Marketplace
- Curated supply of chefs, hosts, and bespoke dining experiences across a small geography.
- Simple intake workflow for talent so we can manage onboarding manually while we validate demand.
- Single surface for guests to browse, request dates, and coordinate payments off-platform while we define the pricing model.

## Live
- Lightweight admin panel that lets the internal team update menus, chef availability, and pricing without redeploys.
- Real-time tracking of bookings and host confirmations so operations can keep events on schedule.
- Alerts and status updates routed to the team when key milestones (booking request, confirmation, prep, event start) change.

## Next Steps
- Finish the MVP user flows above using pnpm-based tooling (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`).
- Hold feature discussions until the Marketplace and Live pillars are fully validated.
